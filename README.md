# PiggyRide Landing Site



**Here we are working on the landing site of PiggyRide, a safe, fast and cheap alternative for inter-city transportation.**



PiggyRide is a ride-sharing agent that takes advantage of large organization connections and next-generation data science matching technology to seamlessly match trusted drivers and passengers.



For inter-city traveling, our price is **more than 6 times cheaper** than that of Uber and our transportation speed is **more than 3 times faster** than Amtrak. We embrace the potential of all drivers who are willing to give piggyback rides in complement of only full-time employees. This way, we can minimize interpersonal contact in this social-distancing world and maximize the benefit of all of our customers.



We are thrilled to announce our service for a customer survey and connect invaluable comments from you.
